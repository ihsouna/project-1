  <h1>The best anime 'One Piece'</h1>
  
  <img src="media/one_piece_1.jpg" alt="image of Straw Hat Pirates from One piece">
  
  <p>One piece is about Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates who sailed the Grand Line in search of the One Piece, a legendary treasure that will make Luffy the pirate king.</p>
  
  <p>The show One Piece is so popular around the world, it hold a Guinness World Record for most copies published for a anime series by a single author.</p>
  
  <p>This particular part from the anime is one of my favorite moments in the entire show.</p>

  <p>One piece has a timeskip on episode 516, where the Straw Hat Pirates go on a training arc for 2 years where the whole crew learns new strengths and self reflect on their techniques, and where they all can grew stronger in order to be able to fight against the powerful emperors of the sea and up the playing field.</p>
  
  <p>Why this scene is sentimental is before Luffy had his training arc he had just lost to the group of robots we see shooting at him. He lost really badly before the timeskip and now we see a whole new Luffy as he dodges the bullets and easily takes down the pacifista.</p>
  
  <p>Also this scene highlights my love for One Piece, as the Straw Hats are always developing and improving to reach their goals. Also my favorite thing about this anime is the character development and the bond we build as viewers to the characters.</p>

  <p>Luffy has a right hand man and thats Roronoa Zoro, he is known for his confidence, sense of humor, and a highly skilled swordsman. He was the first crewmate to join Monkey D. Luffy.</p>
  
  <p>In the clip, Roronoa Zoro took on all of Luffy's pain and fatigue from his battle with Kuma who he had lost too, zoro in order to save his captain and crew, endured immense pain from doing so. Despite his overwhelming pain he already had from the many battles beforehand, he remained standing and later simply said, "Nothing happened," when asked by his crewmates, showing his unbreakable will.</p>
