  <h2>Volleyball is fun</h2>

  <p>I love to play volleyball for fun and competitvely whenever there's good competition.</p>
  <p>Volleyball is a sport I'm able to play with my friends and it helps get my mind off my classes. I started playing my junior year in highschool and made my best friends while playing for my high school team and are people I wouldn't want to lose.</p>

  <h2>Traveling is cool</h2>

  <p>I also love to travel, even though I have only gone to a few states where my family live which is Texas, California, South Carolina, and Florida. I would love to spend a good chunk of my life traveling and having seen what the world has to offer.</p>
  <p>One of the places I would love to go visit is Japan, I love the culture they have and would love to see the many anime places and food they offer.</p>
  
  <h2>I enjoy playing video games</h2>
  <img src="media/rainbow_1.jpg" alt="Rainbow Six Siege">
  <p>Rainbow Six Siege is a game i've been playing for over two years and enjoy playing competitvely with friends. This game is a tactical shooter video game that emphasizes teamwork, strategy, and close-quarter combat. It's a 5v5 game where you get a chance to defend the bomb and where you get to attack the objective.</p>
  <p>This is hands down my favorite video game due to it being a strategy game and you have different operators who have special abilities that help your team win. It's all about strategy and game awareness, and also great aim is important because in R6 there is no respawn and a one shot headshot.</p>
